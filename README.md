# Car-a-day

## Overview

Car-a-day is a web application that works like [Pédantix](https://pedantix.certitudes.org/) or [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but for car enthusiasts.
Every day, users are challenged to guess a specific car model based on limited information. The game provides feedback on each guess, helping players narrow down their options until they find the correct car.
